=====================================================================
Library And Command-line Tools For V120/V124 VME/VXI Crate Controller
=====================================================================

The programs, libraries, etc., are:

============== ============= =============================================
program:       man page:     description:
-------------- ------------- ---------------------------------------------
 libV120       v120 (7)      Library for accessing memory-mapped VME.
 libV120irqd   v120irqd (7)  Library for interfacing with v120irqd
 v120          v120 (1)      Command-line tool for V120
 v120          v120 (4)      Driver for V120
 v120irqd      v120irqd (8)  V120 IRQ dispatch daemon
 v120_tui [1]_ v120_tui (1)  Terminal-based VME register browser
============== ============= =============================================

.. [1] v120_tui is not considered an essential program in this source
       tree. If it cannot compile due to a missing prerequisite
       header/library, the others will still compile.


Building and installing programs and libraries:
===============================================

.. note::

   If you got this code using git instead of receiving a tarball package
   from Highland Technology, you will first need to run the command

   ::

      autoreconf -i

   You will need autotools and libtool to be installed on your computer.

The generic instructions for configuring this source tree for your
computer are in the file INSTALL in this directory.  Briefly, the
shell commands are:

::

    $ ./configure  # or "configure --prefix=/your/preffered/path"
    $ make
    $ make install  # or more likely "sudo make install"

This will install into your /usr/local/ directory by default.
Note that the default installation is not always the best.  Some Linux
distributions will require you to either modify your LD_LIBRARY_PATH or
use a different installation path (the "--prefix" argument) for the
shared-object libraries to work.

Read INSTALL for more information.

If configure fails, then v120, v120irqd, or one of the libraries
cannot be compiled due to a missing header or library on you computer.
If you are running GNU/Linux, then this is unlikely.  email one of
the developers (see AUTHORS in this directory) if you are running
a GNU/Linux system like Ubuntu but the configure script fails.


Building and installing driver:
===============================

See driver/Readme.txt for instructions on building and installing
the V120 Linux driver.


Documentation:
==============

Man pages are in the man/ directory.  They are installed with the
binaries.  To read them without installing, for example v120 (1), try one
of:

::

    man ./man/v120.1

or

::

    groff -T ascii -m man ./man/v120.1 | less

In addition to the man pages, HTML and PDF documentation for the V120's
interrupts are in doc/builddoc/.


Portability
===========

We try to keep this as portable as possible, but still it was designed
for GNU/Linux systems only.

We currenly only have a driver for Linux, so this will not run on BSD or
some other Unix-like operating system.  To make these libraries work on
such a system would require:

* A driver, of course.
* Its ABI must conform to the one discussed in man page man/v120.4.
  (If you have not installed it, try ``groff -Tascii -man ./man/v120.4``
  or ``man ./man/v120.4`` to read it.)
* Some portable-izing (#ifdef'ing) around the linux-kernel-specific
  #include's in driver/v120_uapi.h (which is visible in user-space)
  will be needed.
* The library and tools will need some of their Gnu-specific,
  non-POSIX functions to be tweaked or cleaned up.
