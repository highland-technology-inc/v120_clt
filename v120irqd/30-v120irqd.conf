# This rsyslog filter file will redirect all v120irqd messages to
# /var/log/v120irqd.log.  It will suppress any messages of severity
# lower than ERROR from appearing in the main syslog.
#
# Copy this to /etc/rsyslog.d to use it.  It must have a lower start
# number than the default rules, usually 50-default.conf.
