V120-1.0: HTI SVN commit 5877
  This is the first ``official'' released version.
  Changes from v120-0.6:
  Userspace:
  - Added EXPORT_SYMBOl()s to v120 handles so additional kernel driver
    can use ours.
  - Added the "scan" subcommand to v120 program.
  - Added "v120_tui", a terminal-based register browser.
  Driver:
  - Added DMA support for those V120s and V124s that use it.  See man
    v120 (4) after installing, or "man ./man/v120.4" if not installing.
  - Deprecated the read() and write() calls to v120_v* and v120_c* device
    files.
  - Fixed bug in dkms.conf that prevented driver from getting
    automatically rebuilt and reinstalled upon kernel updates.
  Etc:
  - Added man pages for libraries, tools, functions, etc.
  - Lots of source tree cleanup and reorganization.

V120-0.6: HTI SVN commit 5372, 03-May-2016
  Changes from v120-0.5:
  - Added v120irqd, a daemon program to handle IRQs from V120.
    Documentation is in v120-0.6 source tree, beginning at
    doc/builddoc/html/index.html
  - Moved driver source into application source tree.  During current
    development, the application and driver are too coupled to each other
    to try to keep track of which goes with which unless they are in the
    same source tree.
      The same driver is still distributed by itself as well, for
    customers who do not wish to use the application.
  - Cleaned up dead code in the driver w/r/t DMA that was never
    implemented.
      Also modified some of the driver's data structures.  This should
    have no impact on the API with userspace.
